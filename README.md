# 🍽️ Chef-Mate

**Chef-Mate** is a beginner-friendly recipe book web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to browse, search, and add their own recipes — with a seamless integration of open-source API data from **TheMealDB**. Recipes added by users are stored using `localStorage` so they persist across sessions.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Search Recipes** from both local input and TheMealDB API  
- ➕ **Add Your Own Recipes** with name, ingredients, and method  
- 💾 **Persist Recipes** with `localStorage` (no database needed!)  
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** for better accessibility  
- 🧠 **Smart Search** with real-time filtering  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** (works on all devices)  
- 🧢 **Custom Logo** and a clean professional layout
